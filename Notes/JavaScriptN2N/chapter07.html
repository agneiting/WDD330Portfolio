            <h2>Chapter Summary</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Events occur when a user interacts with a web page.</li>
                    <li>An event listener is attached to an element, then invokes a callback function when the event occurs.</li>
                    <li>The event object is passed to the callback function as an argument, and contains lots of properties and methods relating to the event.</li>
                    <li>There are many types of event, including mouse events, keyboard events, and touch events.</li>
                    <li>You can remove an event using the removeEventListener method.</li>
                    <li>The default behavior of elements can be prevented using the preventDefault() function.</li>
                    <li>Event propagation is the order the events fire on each element.</li>
                    <li>Event delegation is when an event listener is added to a parent element to capture events that happen to its children elements.</li>
                </ul>
            <h2>Questions</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Does mousedown and mouseup mean moving the mouse up or down, or clicking the mouse and the clicker goes down and then up. These both occur before a click event is fired.</li>
                </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="sectionThree, content">
            Whenever an event handler is triggered by an event, the callback function is called. This function is automatically passed an event object as a parameter that contains information about the event.

            <h3>Parameter Naming</h3>
            The parameter does not have to be called event . It can be given any legal variable name, although calling it event can make it easier to read the code. Many developers often abbreviate it to just e .

            You can see a full list on the Events page of the Mozilla Developer Network.

            <h3>Using click and doubleclick On The Same Element</h3>
            You should be very cautious of attaching both a click and doubleclick event to the same element. This is because it’s impossible to tell if a click is the first click of a doubleclick or just a single click. This means that a doubleclick event willalwayscause the click event to fire.

            <h3>Using the touchstart Event</h3>
            Be careful when using the touchstart event as it fires as soon as a user touches the screen. They may be touching the screen because they want to zoom in or swipe, and a touchstart event listener could prevent them from doing this.
            The click event is often a much safer option as it still fires when the screen is touched, but there’s a slight delay of 300ms, allowing the user time to perform another action with the device. The click event can be thought of as a "tap" in the context of a touch event.
