            <h3>Chapter Summary</h3>
            <ul>
	            <li>Comments are ignored by the program, but make your program easier to read and understand</li>
	            <li>Data types are the basic building blocks of all JavaScript programs.</li>
	            <li>There are six primitive data types: strings, symbols, numbers, Booleans, undefined and null.</li>
	            <li>Non-primitive data types, such as arrays, functions and objects, all have a type of 'object'.</li>
	            <li>Variables point to values stored in memory and are declared using the const or let keywords.</li>
	            <li>Values are assigned to variables using the = operator.</li>
	            <li>Strings and numbers have various properties and methods that provide information about them.</li>
	            <li>Symbols are unique, immutable values.</li>
	            <li>Boolean values are either true or false .</li>
	            <li>There are only seven values that are false in JavaScript and these are known as 'falsy' values.</li>
	            <li>Data types can be converted into other data types.</li>
	            <li>Type coercion is when JavaScript tries to convert a value into another data type in order to perform an operation.</li>
	            <li>Logical operators can be used to check if compound statements are true or false.</li>
                <li>Values can be compared to see if they are equal, greater than or less than other values.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Grammar</h3>
            C-style syntax (because of it's similarities with the C programming language).
            <br>
            Best practice: Use both a new line and a semicolon to write each statement.
            
            <h3>Reserved Words</h3>
            Don’t use the following words when assigning variables:
            <br>
            abstract, await, boolean, break, byte, case, catch, char, class, const, continue, debugger, default, delete, do, double, else, enum, export, extends, false, final, finally, float, for, function, goto, if, implements, import, in instanceof, int, interface, let, long, native, new, null, package, private, protected, public, return, short, static, super, switch, synchronized, this, throw, throws, transient, true, try, typeof, var, volatile, void, while, with, yield, undefined, NaN, Infinity
            
            <h3>Data Types</h3>
                1. String - text.
                <br>
                2. Symbol - used to create unique values, which helps to avoid any naming collisions. The main use-case for symbols is as object property keys.
                <br>
                3. Number - Numbers can be integers (whole numbers, such as 3) or floating point numbers (often referred to as just 'decimals' or 'floats', such as 3.14159). 
                <br>
                4. Boolean - true or false
                <br>
                5. Undefined - value given to variables that don't have a value yet.
                <br>
                6. Null - no value. "There should be a value here but there isn't at the moment."
                <br>
                7. Object
            
            <h3>Declaring and Assigning</h3>
            Const - used when the variable will not be reassigned to another value.
            <br>
            Let - used when the variable might be reassigned later.
            
            <h3>Scope</h3>
            Global - variables declared outside of a block, which are accessible everywhere in the program.
            <br>
            Local - variables declared inside a block, usable only in that block.
            
            <h3>Increments</h3>
            points++; // will return 6, then increase points to 7
            <br>
            << 6
            <br>
            ++points; // will increase points to 8, then return it
            <br>
            << 8
            
            <h3>Logical Operators</h3>
            ! (Logical NOT)
            <br>
            && (Logical AND)
            <br>
            || (Logical OR)
            
            <h3>Comparison</h3>
            = to assign a variable
            <br>
            ==  to see if it is (soft) equal to, not including data type
            <br>
            === to see if it is (hard) equal to, including data type
            <br>
            != to see if it is not equal to
            <br>
            > greater than
            <br>
            < less than
            <br>
            >= greater than or equal to
            <br>
            <= less than or equal to
