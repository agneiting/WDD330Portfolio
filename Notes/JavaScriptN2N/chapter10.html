            <ul>
                <li>Bugs are unavoidable in code, and it’s best to find them early rather than later.</li>
                <li>JavaScript can be put into strict mode using the string "use strict" . This can be used in a whole file or just a single function.</li>
                <li>Linting tools can be used to ensure your code follows good practice and conventions.</li>
                <li>Feature detection can check whether a method is supported before calling it, helping to avoid an exception being thrown.</li>
                <li>The console and browser’s built-in debugging tool can be used to interactively find and fix bugs in code.</li>
                <li>Exceptions can be thrown using the throw statement.</li>
                <li>An error object is created when an exception occurs.</li>
                <li>Any code placed inside a try block will pass any error objects to a catch block when an exception occurs. Any code inside a finally block will run if an exception does or does not occur.
                </li>
                <li>Test-driven development is the practice of writing tests that fail, then writing the code that passes the test, then refactoring the code every time a new feature is implemented.</li>
                <li>The Jest framework can be used to test your code.</li>

            <strong>Errors</strong> are caused when something goes wrong in a program. They are usually caused by one of the following:
            <br><br>
                <strong>System</strong> error ― there’s a problem with the system or external devices with which the program is interacting.<br>
                <strong>Programmer</strong> error ― the program contains incorrect syntax or faulty logic; it could even be as simple as a typo.<br>
                <strong>User</strong> error ― the user has entered data incorrectly, which the program is unable to handle.<br><br>

            An <strong>exception</strong> is an error that produces a return value that can then be used by the program to deal with the error. 
            <br>
            An exception will also produce a <strong>stack trace</strong>. This is a sequence of functions or method calls that lead to the point where the error occurred.
            <br>
            A <strong>warning</strong> can occur if there’s an error in the code that isn't enough to cause the program to crash. This means the program will continue to run after a warning. This might sound good, but it can be problematic, since the issue that produced the warning may cause the program to continue running incorrectly.
            <br>
            ECMAScript 5 introduced a <strong>strict mode</strong> that produces more exceptions and warnings and prohibits the use of some deprecated features. Strict mode encourages a better quality of JavaScript to be written and is recommended.
                • Strict mode simply requires the following string to be added to the first line of a JavaScript file:
                    ○ 'use strict';
                    <br>
            The recommended way to determine browser support for a feature is to use feature detection. This is done using an if statement to check whether an object or method exists before trying to actually call the method. For example, say we want to use the shiny new holoDeck API (as far as I know, this doesn't actually exist ... yet), we would wrap any method calls inside the following if block:
                
                if (window.holoDeck) {
                    virtualReality.activate();
                }
                <br>
            Modernizris a library that offers an easy way to implement feature detection andCan I Use?is another useful resource for checking which features are currently supported in different browsers.

            One of the most useful commands is the debugger keyword. This will create a breakpoint in your code that will pause the execution of the code and allow you to see where the program is currently up to. Remember to remove any references to the debugger command before shipping any code, otherwise the program will appear to freeze when people try to use it!

            Throwing exceptions example:
            function squareRoot(number) {
                'use strict';
                if (number < 0) {
                    throw new RangeError('You can't find the square root of negative numbers')
                }
                return Math.sqrt(number);
            };

            <h3>Test-Driven Development </h3>
            (TDD) is the process of writing tests before any actual code. Obviously these tests will initially fail, because there is no code to test. The next step is to write some code to make the tests pass. After this, the code is refactored to make it faster, more readable, and remove any repetition. The code is continually tested at each stage to make sure it continues to work. This process should be followed in small piecemeal chunks every time a new feature is implemented, resulting in the following workflow:

                1. Write tests (that initially fail)
                2. Write code to pass the tests
                3. Refactor the code
                4. Test refactored code
                5. Write more tests for new features

            This is often referred to as the “red-green-refactor” cycle of TDD, as failing tests usually show up as red, and tests that pass show as green.
