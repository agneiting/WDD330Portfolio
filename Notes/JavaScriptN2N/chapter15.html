                    <li>jQuery and Lodash are two popular libraries that provide a large number of useful and well-tested functions.</li>
                    <li>npm and Yarn are package managers that can be used to install JavaScript packages, as well as any dependencies that they require.</li>
                    <li>A module is a self-contained piece of code that provides functions and methods that can then be used in other files and by other modules.</li>
                    <li>ES6 added support for modules, allowing code to be abstracted into their own self-contained files and imported into another file.</li>
                    <li>The MVC pattern is used to organize code into distinct sections that are responsible for different elements of an application.</li>
                    <li>Template files can be used to separate view code from JavaScript; they also enable dynamic code and programming logic to be used to generate markup.</li>
                    <li>React and Vue.js are popular JavaScript view libraries that render components and keep track of their state.</li>
                    <li>Minification is the process of removing any redundant characters from the code in order to reduce its file size.</li>
                    <li>Files can be compressed on the server using the gzip compression tool.</li>
                    <li>Webpack can be used to bundle multiple files into a single bundle, and automate common tasks such as transpiling, minifying code and running tests.</li>
                    <li>Before code is deployed, it should be concatenated into a single file, minified and compressed. The script tag should be placed just before the closing </body> tag to ensure that all elements on the page have loaded before the script runs.</li>

            <h3>Libraries</h3>
            A JavaScript library is a piece of code that provides several methods that make it easier to achieve common tasks. JavaScript is an extremely flexible language that can accomplish most programming tasks – but not all undertakings are as easy to do as they should be. A library will abstract functionality into easier-to-use functions and methods. These can then be used to complete common tasks without having to use lots of repetitive code.

            Advantages:
                • will be used by lots of people and thoroughly tested.
                • will most likely have been optimized and battle-tested for nearly every eventuality.
                • will usually be lots of online documentation and a strong community ready to help out if you become stuck

            Disadvantages:
                • You need to include the code for the library as well as your own code. 
                    ○ increases the amount of code that needs to be downloaded by a website, which in some cases can cause performance issues. 
                •  they might fail to implement the functionality in the precise way that you want it to perform.


            <h3>$ Dollar Sign</h3> 
            The jQuery library uses the $ symbol as a convenient alias for the the global jQuery object that contains all of jQuery's methods. This prevents the global scope from being polluted with any of jQuery’s methods. The $ symbol has become synonymous with jQuery, and you can confidently expect that any mention of it implies that jQuery is being used.

            Don't Use More Than One Default Export
            Having more than one default export will result in a syntax error.

            <h3>MVC(MV*)</h3>
            Components
            • Models are objects that implement the functionality for creating, reading, updating and deleting (known as CRUD tasks) specific pieces of information about the application, as well as any other associated logic and behavior. In a to-do list application, for example, there would be a task model providing methods to access all the information about the tasks such as names, due dates and completed tasks. This data will often be stored in a database or some other container.
            • Views provide a visual representation of the model showing all the relevant information. In a web application, this would be the HTML displayed on a web page. Views also provide a way for users to interact with an application, usually via forms. In a to-do list application, the views would display the tasks as an HTML list with checkboxes that a user could tick to say a task had been completed.
            • Controllers link models and views together by communicating between them. They respond to events, which are usually inputs from a user (entering some data into a form, for example), process the information, then update the model and view accordingly. In a to-do list application, the controller functions would respond to the event of a user clicking on a check box and then inform the model that a task had been completed. The model would then update the information about that task.

            Frameworks
            • Aurelia is a modern framework that uses ES6, and focuses on letting you write dynamic web applications while keeping the implementation details in the background.
            • Angular is a powerful framework by Google to make creating dynamic web applications easier. This is done by extending the HTML language using custom ng- attributes.
            • Ember is a framework designed to make building large web applications easier. It does this by using common conventions that avoid the need for lots of set-up code, though it can become more difficult if you don’t follow these conventions.
